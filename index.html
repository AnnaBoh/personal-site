      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>After 5 years of working as an environmental engineer I decided to change my branch to IT. I started my journey by learning about quality assurance, now I'm expanding my knowledge and experimenting with web design.</p>
      <p>In my personal life I'm a fan of Japanese culture and language. I travelled to that beautiful country five times so far and I'm planning on going there again someday. For me, there's no shortage of things to see there or amazing things to eat there.</p>

      <h2>My Skills</h2>

        <img class="Web" src="images/edit.png" alt="Web design icon.">
        <h3>Web Design & Development</h3>
        <p>My journey of becoming a web designer & developer started with the "Complete Web Development Bootcamp" on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Udemy.com</a>.</p>
        <p>For now, I finished HTML & CSS parts of the course on the intermediate level, along with half of the "Design School" module of the course.  In the near future, I'm looking forward to learning about Java Script.</p>
        <p>I also have a lot of experience with GIMP.  It has been my image editor of choice since college.</p>

        <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
        <p>Since I can remember, I was always a fast learner when it came to technology. I'm competent with working on Windows, MacOS and iOS systems.</p>
        <p>In August 2018 I passed the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level exam. Then I learned a bit of SQL and dabbled with testing websites on <a href="test.io">test.io</a>. Unfortunately, my knowledge of JIRA and SCRUM is only theoretical.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="language" src="images/language.png" alt="Languages icon.">
        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <p>I'm a native Polish speaker, but I'm quite fluent in English. I would judge my English skills to be at a B2 level.</p>
        <p>I started to learn Japanese in high school as a hobby, managing to acquire JLPT certification - level: 4 & 3. However, I would judge my current level of proficiency to be at A1 level.</p>
